Making a Date
I:

Takeshi: Mary, what do you usually do on the weekend?
Mary: Let's see. I usually study at home. But I sometimes see movies.
Takeshi: I see... then, would you like to see a movie on Saturday?
Mary: Saturday is not a good day. (lit., Saturday is a little bit [inconvinient]...)
Takeshi: Then, how about Sunday?
Mary: That's fine.

II:

Mary: Good morning.
Host mother: Good morning. You are early, aren't you?
Mary: Yes, I'm going to Kyoto today. I will see a movie in Kyoto.
Host mother: Good. Around what time will you come back?
Mary: Around nine.
Host mother: How about dinner?
Mary: I will not eat.
Host mother: I see. Well, have a nice day.
Mary: Good-bye.
