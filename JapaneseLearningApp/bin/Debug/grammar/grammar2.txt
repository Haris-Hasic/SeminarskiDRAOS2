X は Y です
"It is 12:30." "I am a student." "My major is the Japanese language." These sentences will all be translated into Japanese using an appropriate noun and the word desu.

    ～です。　　　　It is...

じゅうにじはんです。
Juuniji han desu.
(It) is half past twelve.

がくせいです。
Gakusee desu.
(I) am a student.

にほんごです。
Nihongo desu.
(My major) is the Japanese language.

Note that none of these sentences has a "subject," like "it," "I," and "my major" found in their English counterparts. Sentences without subjects are very common in Japanese; Japanese speakers actually tend to omit subjects whenever they think it is clear to the listener what or who they are referring to.

What are we to do, then, when it is not clear what is being talked about? To make explicit what we are talking about we can say:

_______は　にほんごです。　_______ is the Japanese language.
     wa nihongo desu.

Where _______ stands for the thing that is talked about, or the "topic," which is later in the sentence identified as nihongo. For example,

せんもんは　にほんごです。
Senmon wa nihongo desu.
(My) major is the Japanese language.

Similarly, one can use the pattern X wa Y desu to identify a person or a thing X as item Y.

  X は Y です。    X is Y. As for X, it is Y.

わたしは　スー・キムです。
Watashi wa Suu Kimu desu.
I am Sue Kim.

やましたさんは　せんせいです。
Yamashita san wa sensee desu.
Mr. Yamashita is a teacher.

メアリーさんは　アメリカじんです。
Mearii san wa amerikajin desu.
Mary is an American.

Wa is a member of the class of words called "particles." So is the word no, which we will turn to later in this lesson. Particles attach themselves to phrases and indicate how the phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.

Note also that nouns like gakusee and sensee in the above examples stand alone, unlike their English translations "student" and "teacher," which are preceded by "a." In Japanese, there is no item that corresponds to "a," nor is there any item that corresponds to the plural "-s" at the end of a noun. Without background situations, a sentence like gakusee desu is therefore ambiguous between the singular and the plural interpretations; it may mean "We are/you are/they are students," as well as "I am/you are/she is a student."
