Welcome to Japanese!
Dear user,

Welcome to our Japanese language course. You will be taught Japanese through several chapters. Each chapter is composed of three modules: story, vocabulary and grammar. 

The story module will present a story from the daily life. The story will be presented in both the Japanese and English languages. For the first two chapters the Japanese characters will be accompanied by the corresponding Roman characters. Starting from Chapter 3, you are expected to have learned the Japanese writing systems Hiragana and Katakana.

The vocabulary will list all words used in the story along with their translations, as well as some other commonly used words. As was the case with the story, during the first two chapters the Japanese words will also be written using Roman characters.

Finally, the grammar module will provide explanations for the phrases that appeared in the story of the respective chapter. It may also include information not relevant to the story.

The introductory chapter does not contain a story. Instead, let us start with the most commonly used phrases and some basic notes about the language. Happy learning!
